My first GUI game. The framework and idea came from a Youtube tutorial, but my version is fairly different in execution. Run the JAR to play.

Directions:
WASD to move; survive by not touching the other blocks. Boss fight (and full health regen) happens at level 10. After the boss, random blocks spawn every level.
